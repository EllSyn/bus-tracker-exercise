# Bus Tracker Exercise

## Description
In this exercise the objective was to display a map on a website with markers that tracks the buses on route 1 in real time using the MBTA api. The map is centered over the MIT and the position data for the buses are fetched every 15 seconds.

## How to run
To run this project you have to clone this repo onto your own computer. Then you need to open the [mapanimation.js](mapanimation.js) file and insert your own [mapbox access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). After this you can open index.html in the browser and the project should run.

## Roadmap of future improvements
In the future I would like to add some more bus routes with bus markers in different colors, and maybe also try to color in the routes so they are visible on the map. I would also like to add the possibility for some user interaction. This could be that the user picks which route(s) to display on the map.
